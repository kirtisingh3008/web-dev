      <h2>FOREVER</h2>

             <h2>Kobe Bean Bryant (/ˈkoʊbiː/ KOH-bee; August 23, 1978 – January 26, 2020)</h2></br>
              He was an American professional basketball player. A shooting guard, 
              he  spent his entire 20-year career with the Los Angeles Lakers in the 
              National Basketball Association (NBA).</br>
             Regarded as one of the greatest players of all time,[3][4][5][6].
             </br> Bryant won five NBA championships, 
             and was an 18-time All-Star, a 15-time member of the All-NBA Team,
              a 12-time member of the 
             All-Defensive Team, <h3>the 2008 NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP)</h3>,
              and a two-time NBA Finals MVP.
             Bryant also led the NBA in scoring twice, and ranks fourth on the
              league's all-time regular season scoring and all-time
               postseason scoring lists.
             Bryant, known as “Gigi,” was the second of four children born to NBA basketball 
             legend Kobe Bryant and his wife Vanessa,
             a former model. Her father died alongside her in the crash, which 
             claimed the lives of seven other
             victims including the pilot, according to Los Angeles County Sheriff Alex Villanueva. 
             There were no survivors.
             <h2>Gianna Maria-Onore “Gigi” Bryant was born on May 1, 2006.</h2>
             As a young child, Gigi became a fixture at Lakers basketball games alongside 
             her older sister, Natalia, 17, and her mother. 
             (The Bryants later had two additional daughters after Kobe retired 
             from basketball: Bianka, 3, and Capri, 7 months.)
